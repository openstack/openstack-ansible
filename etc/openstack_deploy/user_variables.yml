## Glance Options
# Set default_store to "swift" if using Cloud Files or swift backend
glance_default_store: file
glance_notification_driver: noop

# `internalURL` will cause glance to speak to swift via ServiceNet, use
# `publicURL` to communicate with swift over the public network
glance_swift_store_endpoint_type: internalURL


## Nova
# Uncomment "nova_console_endpoint" to define a specific nova console URI or
# IP address this will construct the specific proxy endpoint for the console.
# nova_console_endpoint: console.company_domain.name

# This defaults to KVM, if you are deploying on a host that is not KVM capable
# change this to your hypervisor type: IE "qemu", "lxc".
# nova_virt_type: kvm
# nova_cpu_allocation_ratio: 2.0
# nova_ram_allocation_ratio: 1.0

## Glance with Swift
### Extra options when configuring swift as a glance back-end.
### By default it will use the local swift install
### Set these when using a remote swift as a glance backend
#glance_swift_store_auth_address: "https://some.auth.url.com"
#glance_swift_store_user: "OPENSTACK_TENANT_ID:OPENSTACK_USER_NAME"
#glance_swift_store_key: "OPENSTACK_USER_PASSWORD"
#glance_swift_store_container: "NAME_OF_SWIFT_CONTAINER"
#glance_swift_store_region: "NAME_OF_REGION"

## Swift
# This will allow all users to create containers and upload to swift if set to True
swift_allow_all_users: False

## Apache SSL Settings
# These do not need to be configured unless you're creating certificates for
# services running behind Apache (currently, Horizon and Keystone).
ssl_protocol: "ALL -SSLv2 -SSLv3"
# Cipher suite string from https://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/
ssl_cipher_suite: "ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS"
# To override for Keystone only:
#   - keystone_ssl_protocol
#   - keystone_ssl_cipher_suite
# To override for Horizon only:
#   - horizon_ssl_protocol
#   - horizon_ssl_cipher_suite


## Additional pinning generator that will allow for more packages to be pinned as you see fit.
## All pins allow for package and versions to be defined. Be careful using this as versions
## are always subject to change and updates regarding security will become your problem from this
## point on. Pinning can be done based on a package version, release, or origin. Use "*" in the
## package name to indicate that you want to pin all package to a particular constraint.
# apt_pinned_packages:
#   - { package: "lxc", version: "1.0.7-0ubuntu0.1" }
#   - { package: "libvirt-bin", version: "1.2.2-0ubuntu13.1.9" }
#   - { package: "rabbitmq-server", origin: "www.rabbitmq.com" }
#   - { package: "*", release: "MariaDB" }


## Environment variable settings
# This allows users to specify the additional environment variables to be set
# which is useful in setting where you working behind a proxy. If working behind
# a proxy It's important to always specify the scheme as "http://". This is what
# the underlying python libraries will handle best. This proxy information will be
# placed both on the hosts and inside the containers.

## Example environment variable setup:
# proxy_env_url: http://username:pa$$w0rd@10.10.10.9:9000/
# no_proxy_env: "localhost,127.0.0.1,{% for host in groups['all_containers'] %}{{ hostvars[host]['container_address'] }}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}"
# global_environment_variables:
#   HTTP_PROXY: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   HTTPS_PROXY: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   NO_PROXY: "{{ no_proxy_env }}"
