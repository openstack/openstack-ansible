## Ceilometer Options
ceilometer_db_type: mongodb
ceilometer_db_ip: localhost
ceilometer_db_port: 27017
swift_ceilometer_enabled: False
heat_ceilometer_enabled: False
cinder_ceilometer_enabled: False
glance_ceilometer_enabled: False
nova_ceilometer_enabled: False

## Glance Options
# Set glance_default_store to "swift" if using Cloud Files or swift backend
# or "rbd" if using ceph backend; the latter will trigger ceph to get
# installed on glance
glance_default_store: file
glance_notification_driver: noop

# `internalURL` will cause glance to speak to swift via ServiceNet, use
# `publicURL` to communicate with swift over the public network
glance_swift_store_endpoint_type: internalURL

# Ceph client user for glance to connect to the ceph cluster
#glance_ceph_client: glance
# Ceph pool name for Glance to use
#glance_rbd_store_pool: images
#glance_rbd_store_chunk_size: 8

## Nova
# When nova_libvirt_images_rbd_pool is defined, ceph will be installed on nova
# hosts.
#nova_libvirt_images_rbd_pool: vms
# by default we assume you use rbd for both cinder and nova, and as libvirt
# needs to access both volumes (cinder) and boot disks (nova) we default to
# reuse the cinder_ceph_client
# only need to change this if you'd use ceph for boot disks and not for volumes
#nova_ceph_client:
#nova_ceph_client_uuid:

# This defaults to KVM, if you are deploying on a host that is not KVM capable
# change this to your hypervisor type: IE "qemu", "lxc".
# nova_virt_type: kvm
# nova_cpu_allocation_ratio: 2.0
# nova_ram_allocation_ratio: 1.0

# If you wish to change the dhcp_domain configured for both nova and neutron
# dhcp_domain:

## Glance with Swift
# Extra options when configuring swift as a glance back-end. By default it
# will use the local swift installation. Set these when using a remote swift
# as a glance backend.
#
# NOTE: Ensure that the auth version matches your authentication endpoint.
#
# NOTE: If the password for glance_swift_store_key contains a dollar sign ($),
# it must be escaped with an additional dollar sign ($$), not a backslash. For
# example, a password of "super$ecure" would need to be entered as
# "super$$ecure" below.  See Launchpad Bug #1259729 for more details.

#glance_swift_store_auth_version: 3

## Cinder
# Ceph client user for cinder to connect to the ceph cluster

## Ceph
# Enable these if you use ceph rbd for at least one component (glance, cinder, nova)
#ceph_apt_repo_url_region: "www"  # or "eu" for Netherlands based mirror

#  - 10.16.5.40
#  - 10.16.5.41
#  - 10.16.5.42
# Custom Ceph Configuration File (ceph.conf)
# By default, your deployment host will connect to one of the mons defined above to
# obtain a copy of your cluster's ceph.conf.  If you prefer, uncomment ceph_conf_file
# and customise to avoid ceph.conf being copied from a mon.

#  mon_host = 10.16.5.40,10.16.5.41,10.16.5.42
#  # optionally, you can use this construct to avoid defining this list twice:

## SSL Settings
# Adjust these settings to change how SSL connectivity is configured for
# various services.  For more information, see the openstack-ansible
# documentation section titled "Securing services with SSL certificates".
#
## SSL: Keystone
# These do not need to be configured unless you're creating certificates for
# services running behind Apache (currently, Horizon and Keystone).
ssl_protocol: "ALL -SSLv2 -SSLv3"
# Cipher suite string from https://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/
ssl_cipher_suite: "ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS"
# To override for Keystone only:
#   - keystone_ssl_protocol
#   - keystone_ssl_cipher_suite
# To override for Horizon only:
#   - horizon_ssl_protocol
#   - horizon_ssl_cipher_suite
#
## SSL: RabbitMQ
# Set these variables if you prefer to use existing SSL certificates, keys and
# CA certificates with the RabbitMQ SSL/TLS Listener
#
#rabbitmq_user_ssl_cert: <path to cert on ansible deployment host>
#rabbitmq_user_ssl_key: <path to cert on ansible deployment host>
#rabbitmq_user_ssl_ca_cert: <path to cert on ansible deployment host>

## Additional pinning generator that will allow for more packages to be pinned as you see fit.
## All pins allow for package and versions to be defined. Be careful using this as versions
## are always subject to change and updates regarding security will become your problem from this
## point on. Pinning can be done based on a package version, release, or origin. Use "*" in the
## package name to indicate that you want to pin all package to a particular constraint.
# apt_pinned_packages:
#   - { package: "lxc", version: "1.0.7-0ubuntu0.1" }
#   - { package: "libvirt-bin", version: "1.2.2-0ubuntu13.1.9" }
#   - { package: "rabbitmq-server", origin: "www.rabbitmq.com" }
#   - { package: "*", release: "MariaDB" }


## Environment variable settings
# This allows users to specify the additional environment variables to be set
# which is useful in setting where you working behind a proxy. If working behind
# a proxy It's important to always specify the scheme as "http://". This is what
# the underlying python libraries will handle best. This proxy information will be
# placed both on the hosts and inside the containers.

## Example environment variable setup:
# proxy_env_url: http://username:pa$$w0rd@10.10.10.9:9000/
# no_proxy_env: "localhost,127.0.0.1,{% for host in groups['all_containers'] %}{{ hostvars[host]['container_address'] }}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}"
# global_environment_variables:
#   HTTP_PROXY: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   HTTPS_PROXY: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   NO_PROXY: "{{ no_proxy_env }}"


## Multiple region support in Horizon:
# For multiple regions uncomment this configuration, and
# add the extra endpoints below the first list item.
# horizon_available_regions:
#   - { url: "{{ keystone_service_internalurl }}", name: "{{ keystone_service_region }}" }
#   - { url: "http://cluster1.example.com:5000/v2.0", name: "RegionTwo" }

## SSH connection wait time
# If an increased delay for the ssh connection check is desired,
# uncomment this variable and set it appropriately.
#ssh_delay: 5
