# Overview
# ========
#
# This file contains the configuration for the OpenStack Ansible Deployment
# (OSA) Object Storage (swift) service. Only enable these options for
# deployments that contain the Object Storage service. For more information on
# these options, see the documentation at
#
# http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/index.html
#
# You can customize the options in this file and copy it to
# /etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d/swift.yml or create a new
# file containing only necessary options for your environment
# before deployment.
#
# OSA implements PyYAML to parse YAML files and therefore supports structure
# and formatting options that augment traditional YAML. For example, aliases
# or references. For more information on PyYAML, see the documentation at

#
# Configuration reference
# =======================
#
# Level: global_overrides (required)
# Contains global options that require customization for a deployment. For
# example, the ring stricture. This level also provides a mechanism to
# override other options defined in the playbook structure.
#
#   Level: swift (required)
#   Contains options for swift.
#
#     Option: storage_network (required, string)
#     Name of the storage network bridge on target hosts. Typically
#     'br-storage'.
#
#     Option: repl_network (optional, string)
#     Name of the replication network bridge on target hosts. Typically
#     'br-repl'. Defaults to the value of the 'storage_network' option.

#     Number of replicas for each partition. Applies to all rings unless
#     overridden at the 'account' or 'container' levels or within a policy
#     in the 'storage_policies' level. Defaults to 3.
#
#     Option: min_part_hours (optional, integer)
#     Minimum time in hours between multiple moves of the same partition.
#     Applies to all rings unless overridden at the 'account' or 'container'
#     levels or within a policy in the 'storage_policies' level. Defaults
#     to 1.
#
#     Option: region (optional, integer)
#     Region of a disk. Applies to all disks in all storage hosts unless
#     overridden deeper in the structure. Defaults to 1.
#
#     Option: zone (optional, integer)

#     reclaimed, default is 604800 (7 Days).
#
#     Option: statsd_host (optional, string)
#     Swift supports statsd metrics, this option sets the statsd host that will
#     receive statsd metrics. Specifying this here will apply to all hosts in
#     a cluster. It can be overridden or specified deeper in the structure if you
#     want to only catch statsd metrics on certain hosts.
#

#     Statsd port, requires statsd_host set.
#
#     Option: statsd_metric_prefix (optional, string, default ansible_host)
#     Specify a prefix that will be prepended to all metrics, this should be specified
#     deeper in the configuration so different host metrics can be separated.
#
#     The following statsd related options are a little more complicated and are
#     used to tune how many samples are sent to statsd. If you need to tweak these
#     settings then first read: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/admin_guide.html
#
#     Option: statsd_default_sample_rate (optional, float, default 1.0)

#
#   Example:
#
#   Define a typical deployment:
#
#   - Storage network that uses the 'br-storage' bridge. Proxy containers
#     typically use the 'storage' IP address pool. However, storage hosts
#     use bare metal and require manual configuration of the 'br-storage'
#     bridge on each host.
#   - Replication network that uses the 'br-repl' bridge. Only storage hosts
#     contain this network. Storage hosts use bare metal and require manual
#     configuration of the bridge on each host.
#   - Ring configuration with partition power of 8, three replicas of each
#     file, and minimum 1 hour between migrations of the same partition. All
#     rings use region 1 and zone 0. All disks include a weight of 100.
#
#   swift:
#     storage_network: 'br-storage'
#     replication_network: 'br-repl'
#     part_power: 8
#     repl_number: 3
#     min_part_hours: 1

#     zone: 0
#     weight: 100
#     statsd_host: statsd.example.lan
#     statsd_port: 8125
#
#   Note: Most typical deployments override the 'zone' option in the
#   'swift_vars' level to use a unique zone for each storage host.
#
#     Option: mount_point (required, string)
#     Top-level directory for mount points of disks. Defaults to /mnt.
#     Applies to all hosts unless overridden deeper in the structure.

#
#       Option: name (required, string)
#       Mount point of a disk. Use one entry for each disk.
#       Applies to all hosts unless overridden deeper in the structure.
#
#     Example:
#
#     Mount disks 'sdc', 'sdd', 'sde', and 'sdf' to the '/srv/node' directory on all
#     storage hosts:
#
#     mount_point: /srv/node
#     drives:

# --------
#
# Level: swift-proxy_hosts (required)
# List of target hosts on which to deploy the swift proxy service. Recommend
# three minimum target hosts for these services. Typically contains the same
# target hosts as the 'shared-infra_hosts' level in complete OpenStack
# deployments.
#
#   Level: <value> (optional, string)
#   Name of a proxy host.
#
#     Option: ip (required, string)
#     IP address of this target host, typically the IP address assigned to
#     the management bridge.

#     Level: container_vars (optional)
#     Contains options for this target host.
#
#       Level: swift_proxy_vars (optional)
#       Contains swift proxy options for this target host. Typical deployments
#       use this level to define read/write affinity settings for proxy hosts.
#
#         Option: read_affinity (optional, string)
#         Specify which region/zones the proxy server should prefer for reads
#         from the account, container and object services.
#         E.g. read_affinity: "r1=100" this would prefer region 1
#         read_affinity: "r1z1=100, r1=200" this would prefer region 1 zone 1
#         if that is unavailable region 1, otherwise any available region/zone.
#         Lower number is higher priority. When this option is specified the
#         sorting_method is set to 'affinity' automatically.
#
#         Option: write_affinity (optional, string)
#         Specify which region to prefer when object PUT requests are made.
#         E.g. write_affinity: "r1" - favours region 1 for object PUTs
#
#         Option: write_affinity_node_count (optional, string)
#         Specify how many copies to prioritise in specified region on
#         handoff nodes for Object PUT requests.
#         Requires "write_affinity" to be set in order to be useful.
#         This is a short term way to ensure replication happens locally,
#         Swift's eventual consistency will ensure proper distribution over
#         time.
#         e.g. write_affinity_node_count: "2 * replicas" - this would try to
#         store Object PUT replicas on up to 6 disks in region 1 assuming
#         replicas is 3, and write_affinity = r1
#
#         Option: statsd_host (optional, string)
#         Swift supports statsd metrics, this option sets the statsd host that will
#         receive statsd metrics.
#
#         Option: statsd_port (optional, integer, default 8125)
#         Statsd port, requires statsd_host set.
#
#         Option: statsd_metric_prefix (optional, string, default ansible_host)
#         Specify a prefix that will be prepended to all metrics on this host.
#
#         The following statsd related options are a little more complicated and are

#   infra1:
#     ip: 172.29.236.101
#     container_vars:
