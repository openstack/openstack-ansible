# Overview
# ========
#
# This file contains the configuration for OpenStack Ansible Deployment
# (OSAD) core services. Optional service configuration resides in the
# conf.d directory.
#
# You can customize the options in this file and copy it to
# /etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml or create a new
# file containing only necessary options for your environment
# before deployment.
#
# OSAD implements PyYAML to parse YAML files and therefore supports structure
# and formatting options that augment traditional YAML. For example, aliases
# or references. For more information on PyYAML, see the documentation at
#
# http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation
#
# Configuration reference
# =======================
#
# Level: cidr_networks (required)
# Contains an arbitrary list of networks for the deployment. For each network,
# the inventory generator uses the IP address range to create a pool of IP
# addresses for network interfaces inside containers. A deployment requires
# at least one network for management.
#
#   Option: <value> (required, string)
#   Name of network and IP address range in CIDR notation. This IP address
#   range coincides with the IP address range of the bridge for this network
#   on the target host.
#
# Example:
#
# Define networks for a typical deployment.
#
#   - Management network on 172.29.236.0/22. Control plane for infrastructure
#     services, OpenStack APIs, and horizon.
#   - Tunnel network on 172.29.240.0/22. Data plane for project (tenant) VXLAN
#     networks.
#   - Storage network on 172.29.244.0/22. Data plane for storage services such
#     as cinder and swift.
#
# cidr_networks:
#   management: 172.29.236.0/22
#   tunnel: 172.29.240.0/22
#   storage: 172.29.244.0/22
#
# Example:
#
# Define additional service network on 172.29.248.0/22 for deployment in a
# Rackspace data center.
#
#   snet: 172.29.248.0/22
#
# --------
#
# Level: used_ips (optional)
# For each network in the 'cidr_networks' level, specify a list of IP addresses
# or a range of IP addresses that the inventory generator should exclude from
# the pools of IP addresses for network interfaces inside containers. To use a
# range, specify the lower and upper IP addresses (inclusive) with a comma
# separator.
#
# Example:
#
# The management network includes a router (gateway) on 172.29.236.1 and
# DNS servers on 172.29.236.11-12. The deployment includes seven target
# servers on 172.29.236.101-103, 172.29.236.111, 172.29.236.121, and
# 172.29.236.131. However, the inventory generator automatically excludes
# these IP addresses. Network policy at this particular example organization
# also reserves 231-254 in the last octet at the high end of the range for
# network device management.
#
# used_ips:
#   - 172.29.236.1
#   - 172.29.236.11,172.29.236.12
#   - 172.29.239.231,172.29.239.254
#
# --------

#     Defines a container or bare metal network. Create a level for each
#     network.
#
#       Option: type (required, string)
#       Type of network. Networks other than those for neutron such as
#       management and storage typically use 'raw'. Neutron networks use
#       'flat', 'vlan', or 'vxlan'. Coincides with ML2 plug-in configuration
#       options.
#
#       Option: container_bridge (required, string)
#       Name of unique bridge on target hosts to use for this network. Typical
#       values include 'br-mgmt', 'br-storage', 'br-vlan', 'br-vxlan', etc.
#
#       Option: container_interface (required, string)
#       Name of unique interface in containers to use for this network.
#       Typical values include 'eth1', 'eth2', etc.
#
#       Option: container_type (required, string)
#       Name of mechanism that connects interfaces in containers to the bridge
#       on target hosts for this network. Typically 'veth'.
#
#       Option: ip_from_q (optional, string)
#       Name of network in 'cidr_networks' level to use for IP address pool. Only
#       valid for 'raw' and 'vxlan' types.
#
#       Option: is_container_address (required, boolean)
#       If true, the load balancer uses this IP address to access services
#       in the container. Only valid for networks with 'ip_from_q' option.
#
#       Option: is_ssh_address (required, boolean)
#       If true, Ansible uses this IP address to access the container via SSH.
#       Only valid for networks with 'ip_from_q' option.
#
#       Option: group_binds (required, string)
#       List of one or more Ansible groups that contain this
#       network. For more information, see the openstack_environment.yml file.
#
#       Option: net_name (optional, string)
#       Name of network for 'flat' or 'vlan' types. Only valid for these
#       types. Coincides with ML2 plug-in configuration options.
#
#       Option: range (optional, string)
#       For 'vxlan' type neutron networks, range of VXLAN network identifiers
#       (VNI). For 'vlan' type neutron networks, range of VLAN tags. Coincides
#       with ML2 plug-in configuration options.
#
#   Example:
#
#   Define a typical network architecture:
#
#   - Network of type 'raw' that uses the 'br-mgmt' bridge and 'management'
#     IP address pool. Maps to the 'eth1' device in containers. Applies to all
#     containers and bare metal hosts. Both the load balancer and Ansible
#     use this network to access containers and services.
#   - Network of type 'raw' that uses the 'br-storage' bridge and 'storage'
#     IP address pool. Maps to the 'eth2' device in containers. Applies to
#     nova compute and all storage service containers. Optionally applies to
#     to the swift proxy service.
#   - Network of type 'vxlan' that contains neutron VXLAN tenant networks
#     1 to 1000 and uses 'br-vxlan' bridge on target hosts. Maps to the
#     'eth10' device in containers. Applies to all neutron agent containers
#     and neutron agents on bare metal hosts.
#   - Network of type 'vlan' that contains neutron VLAN networks 101 to 200
#     and uses the 'br-vlan' bridge on target hosts. Maps to the 'eth11' device
#     in containers. Applies to all neutron agent containers and neutron agents
#     on bare metal hosts.
#   - Network of type 'flat' that contains one neutron flat network and uses
#     the 'br-vlan' bridge on target hosts. Maps to the 'eth12' device in
#     containers. Applies to all neutron agent containers and neutron agents
#     on bare metal hosts.
#
#   Note: A pair of 'vlan' and 'flat' networks can use the same bridge because
#   one only handles tagged frames and the other only handles untagged frames
#   (the native VLAN in some parlance). However, additional 'vlan' or 'flat'
#   networks require additional bridges.
