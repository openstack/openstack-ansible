OpenStack-Ansible
#################

OpenStack-Ansible is an `official OpenStack project`_ which aims to deploy
production environments from source in a way that makes it scalable while
also being simple to operate, upgrade, and grow.

For an overview of the mission, repositories and related Wiki home page,
please see the formal `Home Page`_ for the project.

For those looking to test OpenStack-Ansible using an All-In-One (AIO) build,
please see the `Quick Start`_ guide.

For more detailed Installation and Operator documentation, please see the
`Deployment Guide`_.

If OpenStack-Ansible is missing something you'd like to see included, then
we encourage you to see the `Developer Documentation`_ for more details on
how you can get involved.

Developers wishing to work on the OpenStack-Ansible project should always
base their work on the latest code, available from the master GIT repository
at `Source`_.

If you have some questions, or would like some assistance with achieving your
goals, then please feel free to reach out to us on the
`OpenStack Mailing Lists`_ (particularly openstack-discuss)
or on IRC in ``#openstack-ansible`` on the `freenode network`_.
