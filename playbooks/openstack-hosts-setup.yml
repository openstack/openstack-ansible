# NOTE(mhayden): CentOS always has python (because of yum), but it's possible
# that Ubuntu nodes may not have python by default. Ansible doesn't work very
# well if Python isn't installed.
#
# Also, we can't use a 'when' to check for the ansible_facts['pkg_mgr'] here because
# we haven't gathered facts yet.
