# This script is being created with mode 0755 intentionally. This is so that the
#  script can be executed by root to rotate the keys as needed. The script being
#  executed will always change it's user context to the keystone user before
#  execution and while the script may be world read/executable its contains only
#  the necessary bits that are required to run the rotate and sync commands.
