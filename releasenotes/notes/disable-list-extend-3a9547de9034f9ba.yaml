features:
  - Yaml files used for ceilometer configuration will now allow a deployer to
    override a given list. If an override is provided that matches an already
    defined list in one of the ceilometer default yaml files the entire list
    will be replaced by the provided override. Previously, a nested lists of
    lists within the default ceilometer configration files would extend should
    a deployer provide an override matching an existing pipeline. The
    extension of the defaults had a high probability to cause undesirable
    outcomes and was very unpredictable.
