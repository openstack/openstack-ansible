    Added the Masakari user to the libvirt group to ensure proper permissions
    for accessing libvirt resources. This resolves permission issues that could
    prevent Masakari from monitoring and managing virtual machine instances
    effectively. The fix ensures that the Masakari service can successfully
    interact with the libvirt daemon for instance evacuation and recovery
    operations during host failures.
