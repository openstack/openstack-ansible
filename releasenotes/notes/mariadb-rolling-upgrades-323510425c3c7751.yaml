upgrade:
  - During a kilo to liberty upgrade, container and service restarts for the
    mariadb/galera cluster were being triggered multiple times and causing the
    cluster to become unstable and often unrecoverable. This situation has been
    improved immensely, and we now have tight control such that restarts of the
    galera containers only need to happen once, and are done so in a
    controlled, predictable and repeatable way.
