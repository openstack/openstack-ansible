    A known issue exists in Horizon where user sessions may be unexpectedly
    invalidated due to internal memoization and cache handling behavior.

    As a temporary mitigation, operators may configure Horizon to use the
    cookie-based session backend by setting the
    horizon_session_engine option to
    django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies instead of a memcached
    session storage backend.
