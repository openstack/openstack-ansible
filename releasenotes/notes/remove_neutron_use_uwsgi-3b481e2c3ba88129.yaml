deprecations:
  - |
    Variable ``neutron_use_uwsgi`` has been removed and has no effect, since
    eventlet mode for ``neutron-server`` has been dropped in 2025.2 (Flamingo).
    uWSGI is the only supported mode at the moment.

upgrade:
  - |
    With removal of eventlet mode for ``neutron-server`` in Neutron, the only
    supported mode for the service is uWSGI. All deployments using eventlet
    will be migrated to uWSGI mode for ``neutron-server``. With that multiple
    extra mandatory services will be started together with ``neutron-server``,
    like ``neutron-rpc-server``, ``neutron-periodic-workers`` and
    ``neutron-ovn-maintenance-worker`` for OVN-based deployments.
