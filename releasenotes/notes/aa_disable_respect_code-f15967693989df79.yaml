    ``os_neutron`` role was ignoring actual exit code of ``aa-disable`` command,
    when it was exiting abnormally. It could result in unobvious failures later
    in neutron agents.
    This was fixed and the role will fail if ``aa-disable`` fails to disable
    required apparmor profiles instead of suppressing the issue.
