features:
  - A new variable has been added to allow a deployer to control
    the restart of containers via the handler. This new option is
    ``lxc_container_allow_restarts`` and has a default of ``true``.
    If a deployer wishes to disable the auto-restart functionality
    they can set this value to ``false`` and automatic container
    restarts that are not absolutely required will be disabled.
