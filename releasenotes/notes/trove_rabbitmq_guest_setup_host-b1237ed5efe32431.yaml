upgrade:
  - |
    When using standalone RabbitMQ cluster for Trove deployment, make sure to
    use ``trove_guest_rpc_host_group`` as a pointer to host group, rather then
    a pointer to a specific host.
    You can use variable ``trove_guest_oslomsg_rpc_setup_host`` to define a
    specific host which should be responsible for provisionment of RabbitMQ
    vhost and users instead.
fixes:
  - |
    Variable ``trove_guest_rpc_host_group`` is now used as intended and
    represents a host group. It is no longer directly used as
    "delegated host" when configuring a standalone RabbitMQ cluster for Trove.
