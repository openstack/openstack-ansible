  - New variables have been added to allow a deployer to customize
    a glance systemd unit file to their liking.
  - The task dropping the glance systemd unit files now uses the

    customize the unit files as they see fit without having to
    load extra options into the defaults and pollute the generic
    systemd unit file with jinja2 variables and conditionals.
