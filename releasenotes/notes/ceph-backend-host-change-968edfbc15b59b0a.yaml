issues:
  - Due to a change in how backend_host is defined when using Ceph, all the
    Cinder volumes will restart under the same backend name.  This will mean
    that any volumes which previously were assigned to the host or container
    that hosted the volume will no longer be managable.  The workaround for
    this is to use the `cinder-manage volume update_host` command to move
    those volumes to the new backend host.  This known issue will be resolved
    soon with an upgrade playbook.
