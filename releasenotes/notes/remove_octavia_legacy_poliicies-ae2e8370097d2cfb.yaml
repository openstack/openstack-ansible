    Variable ``octavia_legacy_policy`` was removed and has no effect anymore.
    In case you was using the variable and it was set to ``True``, you can
    incorporate policy changes this variable was implementing to your
    ``octavia_policy_overrides``. You may find rules controlled by this
    variable via the `link <https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-ansible-os_octavia/src/commit/8d4a94382127f9065ec493800f9a5ceda0154e1a/vars/main.yml#L90-L97>`_
