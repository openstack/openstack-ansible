    All the ocata versions 15.1.15 and before use mariadb-server 10.1 with no
    minor version frozen. The latest version, 10.1.31, has presented problems
    with the state transfer for multi-node environments when the variable
    ``galera_wsrep_sst_method`` is set to ``xtrabackup-v2`` (the default
    value). This causes a new cluster to fail, or an existing cluster to be
    unable to transfer state when a node is rebooted.

    To work around this issue, the recommendation is to set the following
    overrides in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml`` to ensure that
    the last known good version of MariaDB is used.

    From 15.1.16 onwards, these values are set as defaults and will be updated
    from time to time after verifying that the new versions work. As such,
    setting these overrides is not required for 15.1.16 onwards.

       # Use these values for Ubuntu
       galera_repo_url: https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb-10.1.30/repo/ubuntu
       galera_client_repo_url:  "{{ galera_repo_url }}"

       # Use these overrides for CentOS/RHEL:
       galera_repo_url: https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb-10.1.30/yum/centos7-amd64/
       galera_client_repo_url:  "{{ galera_repo_url }}"

       # Use these values for SuSE

       galera_client_repo_url:  "{{ galera_repo_url }}"
