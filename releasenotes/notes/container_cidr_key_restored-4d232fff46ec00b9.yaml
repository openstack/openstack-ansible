    The ``container_cidr`` key has been restored back to
    ``openstack_inventory.json``.

    The fix to remove deleted global override keys mistakenly deleted the
    ``container_cidr`` key. This was used by downstream consumers,
    and cannot be reconstructed with other information inside the inventory
    file. Regression tests were also added.
