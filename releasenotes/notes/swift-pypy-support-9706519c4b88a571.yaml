features:
  - While default python interpreter for swift is cpython, pypy is 
    now an option. This change adds the ability to greatly improve swift 
    performance without the core code modifications. These changes have
    been implemented using the documentation provided by Intel and
    Swiftstack. `Notes about the performance increase can be seen
    here <https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2016/05/06/doubling-the-performance-of-openstack-swift-with-no-code-changes>`_.
upgrade:
  - A new option `swift_pypy_enabled` has been added to enable or
    disable the pypy interpreter for swift. The default is "false".
  - A new option `swift_pypy_archive` has been added to allow a pre-built
    pypy archive to be downloaded and moved into place to support swift
    running under pypy. This option is a dictionary and contains the URL
    and SHA256 as keys.
