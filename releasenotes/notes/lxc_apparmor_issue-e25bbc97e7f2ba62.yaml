    It was discovered that LXC 5.0.3 in Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)
    contains packaging issue resulting in apparmor profiling conflicts.
    A temporary workaround has been applied in ``lxc_hosts`` role to
    apply a hotfix to the profile. However, it will be wiped with the
    next update of ``liblxc-common`` package.
    Please, check the `bug #2110635 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/2110635>`_
    for more details on the issue.
