    Default value of ``haproxy_ssl_letsencrypt_certbot_bind_address`` has
    changed from ``ansible_host``, which could vary based on the deployment
    scenario, to ``management_address``, which will be set to the IP of the
    management network.
    The fallback to ``ansible_host`` is present to avoid failures when
    ``management_address`` is not defined.
