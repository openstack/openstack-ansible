features:
  - For the ``os_neutron`` role, the systemd unit ``TimeoutSec`` value which
    controls the time between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal
    when stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300 seconds
    to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived sessions to drain
    while preventing new ones from starting before a restart or a stop. The
    ``RestartSec`` value which controls the time between the service stop and
    start when restarting has been reduced from 150 seconds to 2 seconds to
    make the restart happen faster. These values can be adjusted by using the
    ``neutron_*_init_config_overrides`` variables which use the
    ``config_template`` task to change template defaults.
