features:
  - The ceph_client role now supports the ability to configure whether
    apt/yum tasks install the latest available package, or just ensure
    that the package is present. The default action is to ensure that
    the latest package is present. The action taken may be changed to
    only ensure that the package is present by setting
    ``ceph_client_package_state`` to ``present``.
upgrade:
  - The ceph_client role always checks whether the latest package is
    installed when executed. If a deployer wishes to change the check to
    only validate the presence of the package, the option
    ``ceph_client_package_state`` should be set to ``present``.
