  - The `max_fail_percentage` playbook option has been used with the default
    playbooks since the first release of the playbooks back in **Icehouse**.
    While the intention was to allow large-scale deployments to succeed in
    cases where a single node fails due to transient issues, this option has
    produced more problems that it solves. If a failure occurs that is transient
    in nature but is under the set failure percentage the playbook will report a
    success, which can cause silent failures depending on where the failure
    happened. If a deployer finds themselves in this situation the problems are
    are then compounded because the tools will report there are no known issues.
    To ensure deployers have the best deployment experience and the most
    accurate information a change has been made to remove the
    `max_fail_percentage` option from all of the default playbooks. The removal
    of this option has the side effect of requiring the deploy to skip specific
    hosts should one need to be omitted from a run, but has the benefit of
    eliminating silent, hard to track down, failures. To skip a failing host
    for a given playbook run use the `--limit '!$HOSTNAME'` CLI switch for the
    specific run. Once the issues have been resolved for the failing host rerun
    the specific playbook without the `--limit` option to ensure everything
    is in sync.
