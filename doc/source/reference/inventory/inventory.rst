OpenStack-Ansible uses an included script to generate the inventory of hosts
and containers within the environment. This script is called by Ansible
through its `dynamic inventory functionality <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html>`_.

In this section, you will find documentation relevant to the inventory
for OpenStack-Ansible.
